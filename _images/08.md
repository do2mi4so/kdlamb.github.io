From 2016-2020, I worked as a research scientist at the [Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences](https://cires.colorado.edu) 
at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, CO. 
My research focused on the sources, optical properties, and atmospheric lifetime of black carbon (BC).
BC is an aerosol (small particulate matter) emitted during incomplete combustion processes,
from both natural (forest fires) and anthropogenic (vehicle exhaust) sources. 
BC is considered the most important short-lived climate forcer, since it strongly absorbs solar radiation, directly heating the atmosphere. 

To better characterize this aerosol in the atmosphere, I took part in several laboratory and aircraft 
field measurements using single particle soot photometers, the state-of-the-art approach 
for *in situ* characterization of these aerosols. Some of the research projects I contributed to are described [here.](https://arcg.is/0DnW4f)
