I studied for both my M.S. and Ph.D. in physics at the [University of Chicago](https://physics.uchicago.edu), where I was 
an NSF graduate fellow and an NDSEG graduate fellow. I graduated with my Ph.D. in the summer of 2015. 

The title of my thesis was 
*In situ isotopic water vapor measurements as a tracer of cold cloud microphysics*.
