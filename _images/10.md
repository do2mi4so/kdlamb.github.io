Stratospheric water vapor acts as a green house gas, with important implications for climate. Cirrus clouds in the upper tropical tropopause layer (TTL) 
regulate the amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere. 
Because the TTL is very cold and dry, water vapor in these conditions is very challenging to measure accurately from aircraft and balloon platforms. 
During my Ph.D. I worked on the design, construction, and characterization of a mid-infrared spectrometer to measure atmospheric water vapor and its isotopic composition in conditions characteristic of the TTL. 

To characterize this instrument in realistic atmospheric conditions, I participated in several research campaigns at the 
[AIDA Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere Chamber](https://www.imk-aaf.kit.edu/73.php) at KIT.
Aquavit II systematically tested state-of-the-art aircraft instrumentation for measuring atmospheric water vapor over a range of different conditions. 
The IsoCloud campaigns focused on characterizing ice growth in ultra-cold cirrus clouds and the fundamental properties of isotopic water vapor at these temperatures.

A paper discussing the instrument we developed is here:
