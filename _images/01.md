Improving representations of aerosol and cloud microphysics in atmospheric models is key to accurately predicting future changes in climate.

Since March 2020, I have been working as a research scientist at Columbia University, where I am investigating new 
hybrid-physics machine learning approaches for parameterizing aerosol and cloud microphysics for atmospheric models.
