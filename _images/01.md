Improving representations of aerosol and cloud microphysics in atmospheric models is key to accurately predicting future changes in climate. Since March 2020, I have been working as a research scientist at Columbia University, where I am investigating new hybrid-physics machine learning approaches for parameterizing aerosol and cloud microphysics for atmospheric models.

Recently I looked at how graph neural networks can be used for zero-shot learning of aerosol optical properties. An Arxiv preprint of this work can be found here:
[Zero-Shot Learning of Aerosol Optical Properties with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10197)

My current research focuses on developing a hybrid machine learning model to predict warm rain microphysics.
