title: Machine learning for in situ aerosol measurements

Aerosols (small particulate matter) play an important role in the atmosphere, impacting both air quality and climate. 
Recently I have been exploring how advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning can be used to improve the classification and characterization of aerosols measured *in situ*.

I published work on improving the classification of absorbing aerosols:
[Classification of iron oxide aerosols with a single particle soot photometer using supervised machine learning.](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/12/3885/2019/)

I have also been exploring deep learning approaches to classifying black carbon aerosol morphology and presented initial results as a 
paper at the Neurips 2019 *Tackling Climate Change with AI Workshop*:
[A deep learning approach for classifying black carbon aerosol morphology.](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2019/52.html)
