title: Black Carbon sources in East Asia
caption: East Asia is a major anthropogenic source of black carbon, an aerosol sourced from incomplete combustion, to the atmosphere.

Since East Asia is the most significant anthropogenic source region for black carbon (BC) aerosol, an important short-lived climate forcer, 
my research during the KORUS-AQ campaign focused on providing new observational constraints 
on the atmospheric abundance and vertical distribution of BC in East Asia. 
The optical properties of BC evolve in the atmosphere, impacting both its climate effects 
and atmospheric lifetime. 

I published an overview of these new observations of BC over S. Korea in the *Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres*:
