Iron oxide combustion aerosols have recently been identified as an anthropogenic source of 
atmospheric absorption, and may provide an additional source of particulate iron 
to the oceans (where they could play a role in the biogeochemical cycle, ultimately impacting ocean uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere). 
However, the sources and atmospheric abundance of these aerosols is still highly uncertain. 

To provide the first global scale atmospheric constraints on these aerosols I developed a new methodology to 
characterize these aerosols *in situ* and analyzed data sets from 102 research flights during the 
[NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission](https://espo.nasa.gov/atom/content/ATom) and the 
[HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/hippo) campaigns.

Two papers using these data sets were recently published in *npj Climate and Atmospheric Science*:
[Global-scale constraints on light-absorbing anthropogenic iron oxide aerosols](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-021-00171-0)

[The underappreciated role of anthropogenic sources in atmospheric soluble iron flux to the Southern Ocean](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-022-00250-w)
