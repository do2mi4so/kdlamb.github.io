Forest fires are a major source of both primary and secondary atmospheric aerosols that impact both air quality and climate. Biomass burning aerosols such as 
black carbon and brown carbon are important contributors to climate direct radiative forcing. 
During the [NOAA 2016 Firelab Laboratory Study](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/firex/firelab/) at the 
[USDA Fire Sciences Lab](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rmrs/research-labs/missoula-fire-sciences-laboratory), 
I spent 2 months in Missoula, MT studying how absorbing aerosols emitted from biomass burning 
can be characterized *in situ*. I collaborated with researchers from NOAAâ€™s Chemical Sciences Division on experiments
focused on a better characterization and understanding of the optical properties of black and brown carbon sourced from biomass burning.

Several papers have been published on these experiments so far:  
*[Investigating biomass burning aerosol morphology using a laser imaging nephelometer](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/1879/2018/)  
*[Inter-comparison of black carbon measurement methods for simulated open biomass burning emissions.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231019301724)  
*[Evidence in biomass burning smoke for a light-absorbing aerosol with properties intermediate between brown and black carbon](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02786826.2019.1617832)  
*[Complex refractive indices in the ultraviolet and visible spectral region for highly absorbing non-spherical biomass burning aerosol](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1200/)
