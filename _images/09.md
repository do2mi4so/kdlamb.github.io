title: Water Isotopologues.

The isotopic composition of water is an important tracer of geophysical and atmospheric processes,
as the preferential deposition of heavy water as ice can provide information about both the
sources of water and its past history. 

My doctoral thesis focused on experimental characterization of isotopic water vapor at low temperatures
as a tracer of cirrus cloud microphysics. This research provided the first experimental verification of the isotopic fractionation factors of water vapor at
low temperatures, in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions characteristic of the upper atmosphere, and was published in *PNAS*:
