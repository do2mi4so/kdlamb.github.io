I participated in the field deployment of the NASA-NIER Korean-United States Air Quality Study, [NASA KORUS-AQ](https://espo.nasa.gov/korus-aq), 
carried out in Korea in Spring of 2016. This aircraft campaign was an international effort to improve understanding of air quality in 
East Asia. 

A CNN article discussing the campaign is [here](https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/asia/nasa-air-pollution-south-korea-photos/index.html).

Some of the research papers describing results of aerosol measurements during the campaign are here:  
*[Investigation of Factors Controlling PM2.5 Variability across the South Korean peninsula during KORUS-AQ.](https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/doi/10.1525/elementa.424/112774)  
*[Understanding and improving model representation of aerosol optical properties for a Chinese haze event measured during KORUS-AQ.](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/20/6455/2020/)  
*[Secondary organic aerosol production from local emissions dominates the organic aerosol budget over Seoul, South Korea, during KORUS-AQ](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/17769/2018/)
