<p>Aerosols (small particulate matter) play an important role in the atmosphere, impacting both air quality and climate. 
Recently I been exploring how advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning can be used to improve the classification and characterization of aerosols measured <em>in situ</em>.</p>

<p>I published work on improving the classification of absorbing aerosols:
<a href="https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/12/3885/2019/">Classification of iron oxide aerosols with a single particle soot photometer using supervised machine learning.</a></p>

<p>I have also been exploring deep learning approaches to classifying black carbon aerosol morphology and presented initial results as a 
paper at the Neurips 2019 <em>Tackling Climate Change with AI Workshop</em>:
<a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2019/52.html">A deep learning approach for classifying black carbon aerosol morphology.</a></p>
