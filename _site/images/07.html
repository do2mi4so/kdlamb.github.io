<p>I participated in the field deployment of the NASA-NIER Korean-United States Air Quality Study, <a href="https://espo.nasa.gov/korus-aq">NASA KORUS-AQ</a>, 
carried out in Korea in Spring of 2016. This aircraft campaign was an international effort to improve understanding of air quality in 
East Asia.</p>

<p>A CNN article discussing the campaign is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/asia/nasa-air-pollution-south-korea-photos/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the research papers describing results of aerosol measurements during the campaign are here:<br />
