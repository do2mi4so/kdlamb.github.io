<p>Stratospheric water vapor acts as a green house gas, with important implications for climate. Cirrus clouds in the upper tropical tropopause layer (TTL) 
regulate the amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere. 
Because the TTL is very cold and dry, water vapor in these conditions is very challenging to measure accurately from aircraft and balloon platforms. 
During my Ph.D. I worked on the design, construction, and implementation of a mid-infrared spectroscopic instrument 
used to measure atmospheric water vapor in conditions characteristic of the TTL.</p>

<p>To characterize this instrument in realistic atmospheric conditions, I participated in several research campaigns at the 
<a href="https://www.imk-aaf.kit.edu/73.php">AIDA Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere Chamber</a> at KIT.
Aquavit II focused on comparing state-of-the-art aircraft instrumentation for measuring atmospheric water vapor over a range of different conditions. 
The IsoCloud campaign focused on characterizing ice growth in ultra-cold cirrus clouds.</p>
