<p>I studied for both my M.S. and Ph.D. in physics at the <a href="https://physics.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, where I was 
an NSF graduate fellow and an NDSEG graduate fellow. I graduated with my Ph.D. in the summer of 2015.</p>

<p>The title of my thesis was 
<em>In situ isotopic water vapor measurements as a tracer of cold cloud microphysics</em>.</p>
