<p>Machine learning is a promising tool for providing new insights into important scientific challenges.</p>

<p>I spent 8 weeks in Mountain View, CA, as a researcher during the 2019 <a href="https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/">NASA Frontier Development Lab</a>, a research sprint to apply AI to earth and space science challenges. 
I worked with the <a href="https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/2019-gnss">Forecasting Geoeffectiveness team</a> to develop a state-of-the-art data-driven machine learning approach for the prediction of space weather phenomena. 
Our team received the Unexpected Discovery Award for investigating how the aurora correlates with GNSS phase scintillations at high latitudes. We presented our work during the NASA FDL Show Case at Google Cloud HQ and at the Neurips 2019 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop:<br />
